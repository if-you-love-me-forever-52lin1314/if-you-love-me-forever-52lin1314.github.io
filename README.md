### The first step is to introduce lin-msg.js 
<script src="https://lin0js.github.io/msg/msg.js"></script>

### Step 2, use one line of code
````
msg.info('Hello lin-Msg')
````
Information prompt, automatically shuts down after 2.5 seconds

## Write it at the back
I have worked on many projects, some of which only require one loading and a nice prompt message, but they need to be implemented by introducing jQuery, Layui, or.... It was originally just a simple purpose, but it introduced so many things into the project. Also, the colleague in charge of the project looked at it and thought, 'Well, what's the point of this big mess? With so many and so complex things introduced, shouldn't we be more careful when making changes?'.
Lin-msg.js has been referenced in some projects.


## Open source project

Dedicated to open source basic information construction, if needed, it can be directly used.
